## Purpose

We all love plants, we all need plants, and in fact, studies have shown that having plants around can help reduce stress. At the same time, however, indoor plants can be hard to take care of because it requires us remembering to water them which another task on top of all of the tasks we have to do. Not only that, but we have to remember when was the last time we watered them so as not to overwater them. Our hope is that though this project we can making caring for a plant much easier by creating an embedded system which measures the water density in your plants soil and lets you know (by a little light) when it is time to water your plant again.

## Initial Design Plan

**Hardware:**
- LEDs: Red and Green
- Soil moisture sensor
- Arduino Uno
- Breadboard 
- Wires
  
*Need: interaction of parts/diagram*
  
**Code:**
- Declaration of variables
- Loop

*Need: specifics & screenshot*
